About the GUI icons - I'd love to see a few options that would represent common commands fairly well. However these suggestions are off the top of my head, probably some others would be super useful too.

- compass (for TP related commands)
- watch (for time related commands)
- name tag (for chat related stuff)
- feather (flying)
- ores (coal, redstone dust, iron, gold, diamond, emerald, for different tiers or values of some commands)
- at least two of music discs
- a throwable potion and a regular potion
- slimeball
- fishing rod
- at least one type of fish
- bow
- swords and armor (maybe helmets or chestplates of all tiers, like leather, iron, gold, and diamond chestplates)
- book
- enchanted book
- apple
- golden apple
- fireworks rocket
- nether star
- empty map
- a neutral and a hostile spawn egg (any)
- head blocks (player, zombie, creeper, skeleton, wither skeleton)
- at least one building block (brick block and stone bricks maybe)

If at least some of these could be added, it would be awesome. Thanks for your hard work!

Ability to purchase commands for 1 time use (Coming v1.2.1!)
Specify commands with spaces! This means a command like /buy sand can block only "buy sand" and allows for it to be independent from "buy glass"
